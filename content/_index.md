## Who Am I

My name is Dimitris Traskas, I am a software engineer and an occasional writer, living in the UK although originally from northern Greece. Automation, multi-agent systems and AI are some of my areas of interest. During the day, I work in the marketing technology industry and during my free time I work on various side projects. Currently I'm working on a simple terminal based cron job monitoring system, that uses AWS Lambdas and DynamoDB to track my cron jobs and alert me whenever something goes wrong.


## My Career Path

I begun my career as a software engineer for a small startup, developing applications that are used in the workforce management space and more specifically in contact centres. I worked on discrete event simulators, demand forecasting and job shop scheduling applications and more. I then moved on to Kubernetes and Python, developing web APIs, identity and address matching technology and working on Cloud platforms such as AWS. I'm currently leading an R&D team with a focus on martech and recent project work on Azure, re-platforming the marketing solution of one of the largest breakdown cover companies in the UK.


## About This Site

I enjoy writing and did quite a bit when I was doing research in multi-agent systems a few years ago. I created this site to practice my writing and to record some of my findings and thoughts. Things that I discover on a daily basis and that are of interest. Ideas that are worth mentioning or even pursuing. Or anything else that I think it is worth mentioning.
