## Who Am I

My name is Dimitris Traskas and I am a Lead Software Engineer at [CACI UK](http://www.caci.co.uk). Automation, distributed systems and AI are some of my areas of interest. I've been a software engineer for almost two decades now and had the privilege to work with some great people on a few interesting projects. I never get tired of new challenges especially if it is to create something completely new. 


## My Career Path

In my early years as a software engineer I did quite a bit of freelancing mainly working in Visual Basic and Excel. I haven't been in touch with VB since those early days, although I imagine there are still plenty of people using it. I then moved on to a consultancy firm where I was exposed to a lot of interesting problems that involved optimisation, simulation and forecasting. After that I started my long standing career with CACI UK where I currently lead R&D work in the marketing sector. Within that period I did AI research with Bath University on Multi-Agent Systems which unfortunately I had to discontinue for personal reasons. More recently I completed a self-driving car course with Udacity which was very interesting to work on.

## About This Site

I enjoy writing and did quite a bit when I was doing PhD research in Bath. I created this site in order practice my writing more and in order to record some of my findings. Things that I discover on a daily basis and that are of interest. Ideas that are worth mentioning or even pursuing. Or anything else that I think it is worth mentioning.
