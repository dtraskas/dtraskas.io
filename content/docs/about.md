# <b>About</b>

I'm an engineer at <a href="http://www.caci.co.uk/">CACI UK</a> designing and building real-time, high performance systems using Kubernetes, Python, AWS and more. My team works on marketing technology developing identity resolution software and APIs that enrich the user experience on the web and mobile.

I have been writing software for the last 20 years and I think that software engineering is unlike any other type of engineering. In university we were taught with the typical analogy of building architects and mechanical engineers. This analogy doesn't seem to work well in many scenarios and distracts from the real complexities of software. Increased complexity in the software development process often makes me think that there must be a better approach. I am always interested in creating new tools, looking at new methodologies and automating as much as possible.

Other areas of interest are autonomous systems and digital electronics especially avionics. I find the recent advances in rocket and spaceship design made by SpaceX, Relativity, Electron and Blue Origin really exciting. I am keen to learn more about the world of autonomous rockets and spaceships capable of landing with no human intervention either on this planet or remote planets in our solar system.
