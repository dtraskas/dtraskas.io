# About

I'm a Software Engineer, designing and building real-time, web APIs using Kubernetes, Python, Golang, AWS, Azure and more. I've been a tech lead for many years and have been specialising in martech, developing Cloud integrations, identity matching systems and data APIs that enrich the user experience on the web and mobile.

I 've been writing software for the last 20 years and my passion for Software Engineering keeps me always interested in new ideas, languages, tools and practices. These days I'm usually working on automation utilising a variety of Cloud services, as well as building Serverless architectures in AWS, Azure and Kubernetes.  

Other areas of interest are autonomous systems, self-driving cars, multi-agent technology where I did research for a brief period and learning new programming languages. I also have a lot of enthusiasm for the latest developments in space exploration technology and more specifically SpaceX's upcoming Starship rocket.
